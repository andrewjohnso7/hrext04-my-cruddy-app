  ## Feature list
  * denotes on my to do for the project
  2.5 days = 20 hours

  ### difficulty scale 1-10. 1 meaning it's already finished 10 meaning what?!?!

  5 = 3 hours
  7 = 5 hours
  10 = full day + ??

  I might want to build the CRUD from scratch for practice. 
  refactor Crud?
  
  Otherwise I'll just decorate it:
  (10??) fix the layout
  I don't really need to change the functionality, but I want it look clean and simple
  I want to make a site that I'd want to use. 
  So that means updating its form more so than it's functionality
  I also want to play with animations 
  I want to store every added input in it's own container and style it so that
  it's not generic
  When the containers are hovered on they should pop out/stand out more. 
  When the containers are selected they move to a separate part of the screen to keep tabs
    on what is currently on the list.  
  (5??)highlight certain items
  (??) ˆI could spend more than a day on this alone, probably willˆ  
  ability to select and delete multiple items (checkbox?)
  (7) search bar for created items
    //placeholders
    //animations
    //fonts
  (7)font changes/choices? (google fonts)

  strike-through completed/deleted items (styling)
  *(5) add due date
  *(7) time stamps (moment.js)
  (5) format the display of the items in a list (need to add more detail)
  (7) color coded priority
  mouse over to see details
  add status/priorty and allow for sorting based on status/priority
  Item categories
  ability to add/leave comments on item
  upload files/images
  share item
  drag and drop to arrange
  search/filter on keyup/keydown
  reminders? (push operation?)
  secret corgi
  delete item confirmation
  fillet edges of boxes
  Panic Button
  Highlight based on status/priority/due date
  options page (ability to set/toggle options)
  show deleted items and allow for undelete
  pagination (if more than 10 show a next button)
  category pages (not really pages, just a show/hide trick)
  add more items button, that shows another input section allowing for multiple items to be added at once
  Fun stuff
  auto-complete when searching/filtering
